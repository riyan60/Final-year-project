# AI Coding Guidelines for Final Year College Project

## Project Overview
This is a final year college project with minimal existing codebase. The project description is in README.md: "This is our collage project" (likely "college project").

## Current State
- No code files present
- Only README.md and empty .gitignore
- No established architecture, workflows, or conventions

## Development Guidelines
- Establish project structure based on requirements
- Use appropriate languages/frameworks for the college project goals
- Follow standard practices for chosen technology stack

## Workflows
- No specific build/test/debug commands defined yet
- Set up version control with Git (already initialized)

## Conventions
- No project-specific patterns established
- Follow common coding standards for chosen languages

Since the project is in early stages, these instructions will be updated as the codebase develops.
